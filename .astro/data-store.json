Many big releases today... software, APIs, and more!\n\nFirst, the biggest. [IE8 has been released](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/default.htm \"Microsoft releases Internet Explorer 8 Beta\") in initial beta. The release was also included a general overview of IE8's new features and fixes. It's actually quite a lot of information to absorb all at once. I've skimmed a number of [the IE8 whitepapers](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ie8whitepapers \"Whitepapers for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8\"), and feel the biggest changes are W3C's [WIA-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/ \"Web Accessibility Initiative-Accessible Rich Internet Applications\") support, [Acid2](http:// \"Acid 2\") compliance, the [javascript selectors api](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=110273 \"selectors api\"), and their assertion of achieving [CSS 2.1 compliance](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=ie8whitepapers&DownloadId=1025 \"css 2.1 compliance\"). Of course, the devil is in the details, and there is no company for which that statement is more true. They have a lot of work ahead, and we know they talk a good game. The big upside, however, is that they are actually talking about it. Out in the open. Big step, and I applaud them for that.\n\nThe other biggest buzz of the day was from Yahoo, in announcing the [beta of their Fire Eagle service](http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/ \"Yahoo Fire Eagle Website\"), an API for broadcasting your physical location to the web. I wouldn't call it earth-shattering, but I think that there's a good chance a number of cool things are built with it. [Watch the video of it's introduction](http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/theater/archives/2008/03/fire_eagle_launches.html \"Yahoo's Fire Eagle API introduced\"), and then [take a look here](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2008/03/05/yahoo-launches-fire-eagle/ \"Yahoo Fire Eagle Quick Overview\") to quickly get an idea of the details. It would appear from the details that it was written in a highly usable way.\n\nOf more direct importance to me, [Google has announced their Contacts API](http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2008/03/3-2-1-contact-api-has-landed.html \"Google introduces Contacts API for accessing Gmail contacts securely\"). I despise when sites ask me to enter my username/password for *other sites*. The most offensive request is for Gmail. I don't have any interesting emails, let me tell you... but I certainly don't want to let others read them. The Contacts API is a safe way for distribution and use of your Gmail contacts, without threatening the security of your Gmail account or your other Google-stored information. With this, I should be able to sync my Gmail contacts with my desktop mail contacts. I'm very happy about that.\n\nHeading up the long-since-overdue category, [AOL has announced they've opened their Instant Messenger Protocol, OpenAIM](http://dev.aol.com/aim \"AOL opens Instant Messenger Protocol, OpenAIM\"). **Finally**. I remember ages ago when... well, it's all in the past now. That's one big wall that has been broken down between protocols, and hopefully Yahoo and Microsoft will fall in line. It will be great if other apps can finally use the features that have been limited to the AIM client for all this time. I use [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/ \"Adium; A Mac Instant Messenging Client\") and [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/ \"Pidgin; Open Source Messenging Client\") most of the time (Adium, I believe uses Pidgin's core), and look forward to seeing what they do with the new open protocol. (On a personal note, hopefully this doesn't spell any negative news for my friends who work on AIM.)\n\nAnd to round things off, here's two smaller releases today (one based on IE8's Activities):\n\n- The [Firefox Operator plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106 \"Operator Plugin for Mozilla Firefox\") (for [Microformats](http://www.microformats.org \"Microformats website\")) has already [given a go at implementing Activities](http://www.kaply.com/weblog/2008/03/05/microsoft-activities-for-firefox/ \"Operator Plugin initial release implementing Activities\"), which were announced at today's IE8 overview.\n- [The New York Times has contributed a perl module to CPAN](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/the-new-york-times-perl-profiler/ \"New York Times contributes profiling perl module to CPAN\").

I wish I had time to do more, but I don't have time for everything. I have been taking long-ish 7 mile rides home, and then going out to play some basketball with my roommates. That's a good time. As soon as I finish this post, I am going to go and fix my fixie... [my favorite Bianchi](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/499906278/)... I somehow mashed the pedals hard enough to shear off part of the thread of both the crank and the pedal, so there go the original cranks and some lovely [MKS Sylvan Track Pedals](http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/pedals.html#platform) that were on there. I've got a new, generic replacement crankset and new Sylvan's. Also, I'm moving from a 42x15 to a 46x17, but with the change in crank length (172.5 down to 165mm) I'll have the same gear ratio as before. I'm interested in seeing how the shorter cranks feel.\n\nNot to mention [le Tour](http://www.letour.fr/us/homepage_horscourseTDF.html) this year...

Still have been good on my New Year's resolution of taking a photo every day... with the exception of Jan 20 (yes, Inauguration Day, the day more people in my Washington DC area took photos than any other this year).\n\nI also got an iPhone. While [I was in California](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157620701884345/) for [Joel and Olga's wedding](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157620771003449/), I dropped my phone of more than 5 years on a rug, and the antenna that had been barely holding on for a few months finally fell off completely. I had previously told myself that I would try to wait until my phone broke before getting a new one. So I was going to buy one at the first sight of antenna problems, until it was suggested that I wait for a new version. Well, my phone's demise and the new version's release coincided, so now I have a 3GS. Really the thing I like most is having my calendar with me at all times. The only other part I really like is the speaker, so I can listen to music while on my bike for the first time.\n\nAlright, so that's about that for the moment.

Browser vendors have optimized JavaScript engines, JavaScript libraries have been honed, and content delivery has been improved. Unfortunately, CSS has received less attention. Developers have been advised how to optimally transfer CSS files, and instructed to use CSS shorthand, but very little has targeted CSS code itself.\n\n[Ms. Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/) is among those looking to improve CSS code. She has been promoting \"[OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss),\" or \"[Object Oriented CSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss),\" her methodology for how to design and refactor CSS [1](#n1). She has collected a number of best practices for architecting a CSS framework. The benefits are simple: CSS will perform better, become more modular, as well as being grounded with a consistent API, making it easier to learn and use. This is accomplished by reducing the file size and complexity of our CSS.\n\nWhile many of these techniques can be considered common practice for experienced CSS programmers, implementing them can be difficult. The art is in analyzing trade-offs and picking the optimal path. That said, these rules are not for everyone, or every site. It all boils down to deciding if the site's performance gain is greater than the time it takes to learn and use the techniques.\n\n## Useful for sites with\n\n- Many pages\n- A common visual and structural design\n- Critical performance requirements\n\n### Less useful for sites with\n\n- A few pages or just one page\n- Varying design (possibly \"portfolio\" or design sites)\n- Few performance concerns\n\nSo how do we get started? We go hunting for bad code smells. In Chapter 3 of [*Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code*](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672), [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) and [Kent Beck](http://twitter.com/kentbeck) coin the phrase \"code smell,\" meaning \"structures in the code that suggest the possibility of refactoring.\" Simply put, we go looking for chunks of code that our intuition tells us could be cleaned. In the chapter heading, Grandma Beck is quoted (then talking about child-rearing), \"If it stinks, change it.\" We'll take a more formal approach to finding these code smells, going from easy to difficult. First, we'll sniff around the CSS selectors, and then move onto the CSS properties. Finally we'll look for visual design patterns that can direct the structure of our CSS.\n\nSelectors\n---------\n\nSelectors are both the easiest place to find code smells in CSS and the easiest to correct. Three big code smells tend to stink up CSS selectors; unused selectors, location-based selectors, and overly specific selectors. Each contributes significantly to increased CSS file size.\n\n### Unused Selectors\n\nCode that does nothing is obviously wasteful, and is the first candidate for removal. Tools like dust me selectors that can spider a site can identify all of the unused or orphaned styles that your stylesheets still contain.\n\n### Location-based Selectors\n\nLocation-based selectors prohibit code reuse because they are intended to isolate styles for a specific part of the page, yet frequently used HTML components are often reused in a different context. Therefore, its counterproductive to hard-code that initial context into a selector.\n\nLocation-based selectors are easy to spot. The pattern is a long list of selectors that starts with the same initial selector, as follows (assuming the source is reasonably ordered).\n\n```\n.sidebar {...}\n.sidebar .nav {...}\n.sidebar .nav .box {...}\n.sidebar .nav .box .header {...}\n.sidebar .nav .box .body p {...}\n```\n\nBecause each selector chain starts with a location-based selector, none of them are reusable. What if we add a new group of pages that use the same .box structure but need to be placed in the content, header, or footer? A novice would add more comma separated selector chains, but that amounts to copying code.  \n\n```\n.sidebar .nav .box, .content .nav .box, .header .nav .box, .footer .nav .box {...}\n```\n\nThe correct approach is to factor out the common functionality while ditching the location-based rules. Now the styles can be reused regardless of the box location.\n\n```\n.box {...}\n.box .header {...}\n.box .footer {...}\n```\n\nWhy not break the .box and .header/.footer chains apart? Here the .box class encapsulates the .header and .footer behaviors, hiding these names from the global scope and allowing the \"header\" and \"footer\" classnames to be used elsewhere.\n\nTo those looking ahead to HTML5, you should already recognize how this pattern can be applied to section elements containing header and footer elements.\n\n### Varying specificity\n\nBy 2010, everyone should be aware that adding \"style\" attributes directly to HTML elements is a bad idea (and code smell). What about everything else?\n\nSelectors that contain properties set as `!important` should be avoided because their specificity makes them difficult to override.\n\nBrowser selector hacks like `* html {...}` should be avoided because they tend to require redefinition of both the problem properties and all other properties, leading to duplicate code. When hacks are needed, use property hacks like the star (IE7 and less) and underscore (IE6 and less) instead.\n\nBecause IDs can be used only once per-page, selectors containing IDs can typically only be used in a specific place on each page. IDs are great when you need to grab something from the DOM in JavaScript, but avoid them in your CSS.\n\nElement selectors should be used to provide element defaults, especially when redefining styles previously zeroed out by a reset stylesheet. Using them for anything but defaults tends to yield repetitive CSS.\n\nKeeping selector specificity as similar as possible makes it easy to use classes that only define differences.\n\nHTML:\n\n```xml\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n\u003Cdiv>Default (black) box\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>Green box\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv> Red box\u003C/div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n\n```\n.box { padding:1em; color:black; border: 1px solid black; }\n\n/* simple selectors because the specificity is equal to the base \".box\" object's selector */\n.green_border { border: 2px solid green; }\n.red_border { border: 2px solid red; }\n```\n\nProperties\n----------\n\nProperties appear in CSS more frequently than selectors, and as a result their quantity masks their code smells a bit. However we can exploit their frequency to find repetitive code [2](#n2).\n\n### Margin: 0 and padding: 0\n\nResetting the margin and padding properties to zero is extremely common. Using a reset stylesheet will help you do this everywhere in one place. A reset will zero all margin and padding properties, leaving only the non-zero values left to set. If you find that your CSS contains more instances setting the margin or padding to another value (for example, 1em), you can edit your reset or add a global rule setting this alternate default.\n\nBefore:\n\n(my.css)\n\n```\n.portlet {margin:0; padding:0; ... }\n.header {margin:0; padding:0; ... }\n.footer {margin:0; padding:0; ...}\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n(Reset.css)\n\n```\ndiv {margin:0; padding:0}\n```\n\n(my.css)\n\n```\n.portlet { ... }\n.header { ... }\n.footer { ... }\n```\n\n### Float\n\nOveruse of the float property is a code smell indicating repetition in placing items on a page. Use of a grid structure will reduce duplication caused by object placement. Rather than have each element float itself, a grid structure will do this all one time only.\n\n### Font-size\n\nIt's rare for sites to use multiple sizes of body text on one page, or site wide. Therefore most font-size properties are likely used to define header-like text sizes. [Ms. Sullivan does an excellent job pointing out](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/07/01/top-5-mistakes-of-massive-css/), that of a finite number of font-sizes that can be used on a page, there are even fewer that a user can differentiate (for example the difference between 15px and 16px browser font sizes). Font-size therefore is usually a code smell for repeating headers.\n\n### Mingling box model, visual formatting model, and presentational properties\n\nThe CSS specification groups similar properties into sections. The Box model is the most famous (because it had previously been the most infamous). Everyone is familiar with its margins, paddings, and borders building on widths and heights. The Visual formatting model uses the display, position, float, clear, and z-index properties to dictate the layout of the boxes in the document. The CSS specification makes no mention of \"presentational properties,\" but that's a term I use to include color, background, font, and text properties that style the boxes or their contents.\n\nSeparating selectors along these lines allows for greater code reuse. The box model properties are the most easily re-used of the three. It is not uncommon for a number of boxes on the page to share the same properties, so moving these properties into a new class will allow you to apply these styles in a consistent and efficient manner. The visual formatting properties are typically less likely to be reused, therefore separating them from the boxes will allow greater reuse of both the visual formatting and box properties.\n\nIt must be noted, however, that there will be cases where the same box model properties will often be paired with the same visual formatting properties. In that case it is perfectly acceptable to leave them coupled together.\n\nPresentational properties are the least likely set to be reused. This isn't surprising because they are typically dependent on the contents of the boxes. That makes these the most logical candidate for extraction, because doing so will increase the usability of the remaining properties.\n\nKeep in mind we are still trying to build a consistent API for others to use. Creating new patterns of box model, visual formatting model, and presentational property oriented classes will give future developers a wide range of flexibility to mix-and-match these classes while styling new elements.\n\nVisual design patterns\n----------------------\n\nIn the last section, we looked at the effects of mingling box model, visual formatting model, and presentational properties. Searching for visual design patterns is the next logical step, albeit a complicated one.\n\nThis technique is tricky. Unlike the others, this has the additional restriction in that it is usually only suitable for finished designs. Attempting this on an in-development design may send you on the road toward madness. Additionally, it doesn't lend itself very well to searching code. In effect we are looking for repeating groups of CSS properties... but these properties can typically span multiple selectors! So instead of looking to the code for patterns, we look for patterns in the other direction, at the visual output.\n\nThis technique also takes the longest, since it requires looking at all of the pages on a site as a whole.\n\n### Headers\n\nFinding headers on the page should be fairly simple, and to be honest, you've probably taken care of this searching for repeated font-size properties as described above. However a visual inventory may convince you that your headers are more alike than different, and you may find an opportunity to tighten the differences. You may even decide to dump one of the variations-even better.\n\n### Portlets\n\nIn a portal or information dashboard oriented design, each chunk of output, whether contained in a box/window type structure, or structure-less (think Apple's Dashboard) is bound to share common characteristics. In the structure-less design you can focus on extracting the visual formatting properties into reusable classes defining position. Box or window contained portlets can be constructed using a combination of box model, and presentational properties. And if you're using a dashboard design, these chunks of output can probably be arranged using a grid structure.\n\n### Grids\n\nAlignment is the key to identifying patterns where grids can be applied. Take five steps back from your monitor and look at the top-level page objects. If some of these objects are loosely aligned, they can probably be included into a grid. Sketch the grid and the objects within on a piece of paper. Now walk three steps forward, and look at the each individual section in your wireframe. If you identify objects aligned in your sections, you may be primed for using a nested grid. Sketch that grid (have you realized that you're wireframing yet?). Keep going until you've exhausted all of the sections you've drawn (have you realized you're using recursion yet?)\n\nThen start the tedious process of tearing out the previous code and replacing with a grid structure.. The end product will be far more efficient and easier to maintain. (Which grid should you use? Which every you choose! As long as you are using one your code will be cleaner and more efficient.)\n\n### \"Media Blocks\"\n\nOne pattern that Ms. Sullivan found frequently on the Facebook site is something she has coined a \"Media Block,\" which [she defines](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/) as \"an image to the left, with descriptive content to the right.\" Simply put, this is just a compound object, which is slightly more abstract than the previous examples. She analyzes these media blocks in two steps. First define their constant functional properties (what they do), then identify the variables in the design (parts could fluctuate in certain conditions).\n\nNot all sites will contain objects like these, but if yours does, identifying the patterns will help to reduce code duplication and promote code reuse.\n\n### More\n\nThis short list couldn't hope to represent the entirety of the visual design patterns that can be found on a website. That's why a site inventory is required. If you find similar patterns repeating multiple times, this is a chance for you to optimize.\n\nResults\n-------\n\nOnce these rules have been applied, your file size should be smaller, so less information has to be downloaded, making the page load faster. The overall complexity of your CSS rules should also be reduced, meaning the browser will have less redundant rules to apply, and your page should load faster. And finally, you will have defined an API for common CSS across your site, making it easier for developers to create new pages.\n\n- - - - - -\n\nFootnotes\n---------\n\n1 Personally, I find the choice of the \"OOCSS\" or \"Object Oriented CSS\" name both poor and misleading. To call something \"Object Oriented\" when the metaphor doesn't fit (CSS has no data per se, and it certainly has no methods) is confusing, especially when the audience is likely to be familiar with the term. To then give your CSS library the same name and overload the term twice obscures a very useful set of CSS refactoring methods.\n\n2 This can be accomplished with the Unix tool grep, a powerful text searching utility. It is also possible to accomplish this through your editor, as long as it supports searching multiple files at once. It is especially useful to be able to count occurrences across files.","src/content/blog/high-performance-css-code-design.md","00f698df8be9b619",{"html":988,"metadata":989},"\u003Cp>In the last few years much emphasis has been placed on web performance issues.

Using a reset stylesheet will help you do this everywhere in one place. A reset will zero all margin and padding properties, leaving only the non-zero values left to set. If you find that your CSS contains more instances setting the margin or padding to another value (for example, 1em), you can edit your reset or add a global rule setting this alternate default.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(my.css)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code css-variables\" style=\"background-color:var(--astro-code-background);color:var(--astro-code-foreground); overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>.portlet {margin:0; padding:0; ... }\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>.header {margin:0; padding:0; ... }\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>.footer {margin:0; padding:0; ...}\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>After:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(Reset.css)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code css-variables\" style=\"background-color:var(--astro-code-background);color:var(--astro-code-foreground); overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>div {margin:0; padding:0}\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>(my.css)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code css-variables\" style=\"background-color:var(--astro-code-background);color:var(--astro-code-foreground); overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>.portlet { ... }\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>.header { ... }\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>.footer { ... }\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"float\">Float\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Overuse of the float property is a code smell indicating repetition in placing items on a page. Use of a grid structure will reduce duplication caused by object placement. Rather than have each element float itself, a grid structure will do this all one time only.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"font-size\">Font-size\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>It’s rare for sites to use multiple sizes of body text on one page, or site wide. Therefore most font-size properties are likely used to define header-like text sizes. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/07/01/top-5-mistakes-of-massive-css/\">Ms. Sullivan does an excellent job pointing out\u003C/a>, that of a finite number of font-sizes that can be used on a page, there are even fewer that a user can differentiate (for example the difference between 15px and 16px browser font sizes). Font-size therefore is usually a code smell for repeating headers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"mingling-box-model-visual-formatting-model-and-presentational-properties\">Mingling box model, visual formatting model, and presentational properties\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The CSS specification groups similar properties into sections. The Box model is the most famous (because it had previously been the most infamous). Everyone is familiar with its margins, paddings, and borders building on widths and heights. The Visual formatting model uses the display, position, float, clear, and z-index properties to dictate the layout of the boxes in the document. The CSS specification makes no mention of “presentational properties,” but that’s a term I use to include color, background, font, and text properties that style the boxes or their contents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Separating selectors along these lines allows for greater code reuse. The box model properties are the most easily re-used of the three. It is not uncommon for a number of boxes on the page to share the same properties, so moving these properties into a new class will allow you to apply these styles in a consistent and efficient manner. The visual formatting properties are typically less likely to be reused, therefore separating them from the boxes will allow greater reuse of both the visual formatting and box properties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It must be noted, however, that there will be cases where the same box model properties will often be paired with the same visual formatting properties. In that case it is perfectly acceptable to leave them coupled together.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Presentational properties are the least likely set to be reused. This isn’t surprising because they are typically dependent on the contents of the boxes. That makes these the most logical candidate for extraction, because doing so will increase the usability of the remaining properties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Keep in mind we are still trying to build a consistent API for others to use. Creating new patterns of box model, visual formatting model, and presentational property oriented classes will give future developers a wide range of flexibility to mix-and-match these classes while styling new elements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"visual-design-patterns\">Visual design patterns\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the last section, we looked at the effects of mingling box model, visual formatting model, and presentational properties. Searching for visual design patterns is the next logical step, albeit a complicated one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This technique is tricky. Unlike the others, this has the additional restriction in that it is usually only suitable for finished designs. Attempting this on an in-development design may send you on the road toward madness. Additionally, it doesn’t lend itself very well to searching code. In effect we are looking for repeating groups of CSS properties… but these properties can typically span multiple selectors! So instead of looking to the code for patterns, we look for patterns in the other direction, at the visual output.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This technique also takes the longest, since it requires looking at all of the pages on a site as a whole.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"headers\">Headers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Finding headers on the page should be fairly simple, and to be honest, you’ve probably taken care of this searching for repeated font-size properties as described above. However a visual inventory may convince you that your headers are more alike than different, and you may find an opportunity to tighten the differences. You may even decide to dump one of the variations-even better.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"portlets\">Portlets\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In a portal or information dashboard oriented design, each chunk of output, whether contained in a box/window type structure, or structure-less (think Apple’s Dashboard) is bound to share common characteristics. In the structure-less design you can focus on extracting the visual formatting properties into reusable classes defining position. Box or window contained portlets can be constructed using a combination of box model, and presentational properties. And if you’re using a dashboard design, these chunks of output can probably be arranged using a grid structure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"grids\">Grids\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Alignment is the key to identifying patterns where grids can be applied. Take five steps back from your monitor and look at the top-level page objects. If some of these objects are loosely aligned, they can probably be included into a grid. Sketch the grid and the objects within on a piece of paper. Now walk three steps forward, and look at the each individual section in your wireframe. If you identify objects aligned in your sections, you may be primed for using a nested grid. Sketch that grid (have you realized that you’re wireframing yet?). Keep going until you’ve exhausted all of the sections you’ve drawn (have you realized you’re using recursion yet?)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then start the tedious process of tearing out the previous code and replacing with a grid structure.. The end product will be far more efficient and easier to maintain. (Which grid should you use? Which every you choose! As long as you are using one your code will be cleaner and more efficient.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"media-blocks\">”Media Blocks”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>One pattern that Ms. Sullivan found frequently on the Facebook site is something she has coined a “Media Block,” which \u003Ca href=\"http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/\">she defines\u003C/a> as “an image to the left, with descriptive content to the right.” Simply put, this is just a compound object, which is slightly more abstract than the previous examples. She analyzes these media blocks in two steps. First define their constant functional properties (what they do), then identify the variables in the design (parts could fluctuate in certain conditions).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not all sites will contain objects like these, but if yours does, identifying the patterns will help to reduce code duplication and promote code reuse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"more\">More\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This short list couldn’t hope to represent the entirety of the visual design patterns that can be found on a website. That’s why a site inventory is required. If you find similar patterns repeating multiple times, this is a chance for you to optimize.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"results\">Results\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Once these rules have been applied, your file size should be smaller, so less information has to be downloaded, making the page load faster. The overall complexity of your CSS rules should also be reduced, meaning the browser will have less redundant rules to apply, and your page should load faster. And finally, you will have defined an API for common CSS across your site, making it easier for developers to create new pages.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>1 Personally, I find the choice of the “OOCSS” or “Object Oriented CSS” name both poor and misleading. To call something “Object Oriented” when the metaphor doesn’t fit (CSS has no data per se, and it certainly has no methods) is confusing, especially when the audience is likely to be familiar with the term. To then give your CSS library the same name and overload the term twice obscures a very useful set of CSS refactoring methods.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>2 This can be accomplished with the Unix tool grep, a powerful text searching utility. It is also possible to accomplish this through your editor, as long as it supports searching multiple files at once. It is especially useful to be able to count occurrences across files.\u003C/p>",{"headings":990,"localImagePaths":1048,"remoteImagePaths":1049,"frontmatter":1050,"imagePaths":1057},[991,994,997,1000,1003,1006,1009,1012,1015,1018,1021,1024,1027,1030,1033,1036,1039,1042,1045],{"depth":195,"slug":992,"text":993},"useful-for-sites-with","Useful for sites with",{"depth":199,"slug":995,"text":996},"less-useful-for-sites-with","Less useful for sites with",{"depth":195,"slug":998,"text":999},"selectors","Selectors",{"depth":199,"slug":1001,"text":1002},"unused-selectors","Unused Selectors",{"depth":199,"slug":1004,"text":1005},"location-based-selectors","Location-based Selectors",{"depth":199,"slug":1007,"text":1008},"varying-specificity","Varying specificity",{"depth":195,"slug":1010,"text":1011},"properties","Properties",{"depth":199,"slug":1013,"text":1014},"margin-0-and-padding-0","Margin: 0 and padding: 0",{"depth":199,"slug":1016,"text":1017},"float","Float",{"depth":199,"slug":1019,"text":1020},"font-size","Font-size",{"depth":199,"slug":1022,"text":1023},"mingling-box-model-visual-formatting-model-and-presentational-properties","Mingling box model, visual formatting model, and presentational properties",{"depth":195,"slug":1025,"text":1026},"visual-design-patterns","Visual design patterns",{"depth":199,"slug":1028,"text":1029},"headers","Headers",{"depth":199,"slug":1031,"text":1032},"portlets","Portlets",{"depth":199,"slug":1034,"text":1035},"grids","Grids",{"depth":199,"slug":1037,"text":1038},"media-blocks","”Media Blocks”",{"depth":199,"slug":1040,"text":1041},"more","More",{"depth":195,"slug":1043,"text":1044},"results","Results",{"depth":195,"slug":1046,"text":1047},"footnotes","Footnotes",[],[],{"title":979,"date":1051,"status":33,"permalink":1052,"author":35,"excerpt":36,"type":37,"id":1053,"categories":1054,"tags":1055,"post_format":1056},"2011-04-06T00:44:25-05:00","/2011/04/06/high-performance-css-code-design",330,[272,526,527],[272,982,526,983],[],[],"horror-movies-final-installment",{"id":1058,"data":1060,"body":1067,"filePath":1068,"digest":1069,"rendered":1070},{"title":1061,"date":1062,"tags":1063},"Horror Movies, Final installment",["Date","2008-11-11T17:47:43.000Z"],[1064,1065,1066],"halloween","movies","scary","The final installment... a little late.\n\n- [Amityville Horror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078767/) -- (The OLD one, not the new one.)

The first one was actually thrown into my lap as a twitter discussion between [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/) (down-to-earth web guy) and [Chris Wilson](http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/) (works on IE). Following the twitter-timeline, [first](http://twitter.com/adactio/statuses/627930532), [second](http://twitter.com/cwilso/statuses/628255922), [third](http://twitter.com/adactio/statuses/628305212).

Hopefully, both Jeremy and Chris and the other powers that be work that detail out further before Microsoft proceeds.\n\nMy second worry is the case of \"edge.\" Edge, as far as I am concerned, stands for bleeding edge, and that implies an experimental version, where results will be unpredictable.  (I infer that definition based on every other software release that I've heard of.) Hopefully that's not the case, but there sure as heck better be a concrete definition of what they consider \"edge\".  Hopefully they'll throw a \"current major version\" in there as well.  Who knows.\n\nThe third, and probably largest concern that I have, is that we are now relying on Microsoft to include past browser rendering attributes into current browsers. So IE8 should be able to render all of IE7's quirks, as well as IE6's quirks. Based on the fact that Microsoft had a hard time fully flushing out all of the CSS standards for so long, whats to say that that they'll accomplish this in full. Additionally, there are the worries that including past rendering attribues will yeild the \"bloatware\" that Eric mentioned.\n\nAnd finally (at least for today) there's the mess of doctype and meta.

I probably don't need to mention that they've been pretty high on the \"buzz\" list for a while now. That aside, I like the idea, and believe they are worth using. With this post, I hope to give a high-level overview of Microformats... first sampling what they are and how to use them, followed by my thoughts on why you should use them.\n\n**What and How**\n\nVery simply, Microformats give our already semantic xhtml elements an extra layer of meaning when using a common set of attribute values. Consider the case of an \"[hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar)\", a microformat that gives xhtml the structure of an events calendar. An events calendar is simply a set of events. This relationship is easily described by a parent-children relationship. The problem is that xhtml can easily describe parent-children relationships, yet it cannot semantically describe this calendar-events relationship. Microformats do just that... they provide a way to describe this common relationship through the use of attribute values.\n\nTo create an \"hCalendar\", you would write something like the following:\n\n```\n> \u003Cdiv class=\"vcalendar\">\n> \n> > \u003Cspan class=\"vevent\"/>  \n> > \u003Cdiv class=\"vevent\"/>  \n> > \u003Cdl class=\"vevent\"/>\n> \n> \u003C/div>\n```\n\nAs you can see, the supplementary calendar-events structure is added by setting specific attribute values, in this case 'vcalendar' and 'vevent'. Microformats use exiting attributes like 'class' and 'rel' as hooks for this structure, in the same way these attributes can be used as hooks for additional CSS information. Additionally, these attributes can be applied to whichever element you choose\\*. I demonstrated the use of the same attribute/value pair (class=\"vevent\") on the 'span', 'div', and 'dl' elements in the example above.\n\n\\[\\* The rules for applying attributes to elements are the same as [the existing xhtml spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/)\\]\n\n**Why you should use them**\n\nWhile I foresee a wide array of future uses for Microformats, there are limited practical applications today. That being said, the small number does not mean they have limited value; their use can provide substantial value. For example: later this week I am going to re-write the [concert-listing page](http://columbiaorchestra.org/season/) for my [ orchestra website](http://columbiaorchestra.org). I am going to use the hCalendar Microformat to code this season's events. I will then use an open-source converter to allow users to download a iCal file of this calendar on the fly.\n\nWhy would I do this? Because it's advantageous. Using the hCalendar Microformat I can...\n\n- provide an additional interface (the iCal file) to my users for free.\n- syndicate these events. That way, if I ping a Microformat aware service (like [pingerati.net](http://pingerati.net/)) I will have published these events elsewhere, without any additional work.\n- maintain only one source file for multiple outputs (in this case, html, iCal file, and syndicated content)\n- use my current knowledge of html as a base for the syntax, requiring me only to learn the Microformats terms and schema before I start using them\n\nThere are similar uses for the other Microformats, including hCard (contact info), geo and adr (location/address), XFN (relationships between people), and so on. I invite you to take a look at the [book](http://microformats.org/blog/2007/04/19/microformats-the-book/) or the [Microformats website](http://microformats.org/) for more information.\n\nI hope that's enough to convince you that Microformats are a valid and useful technology. One of the more compelling aspects is [the way Microformats are created](http://microformats.org/wiki/process), yet I think that is interesting enough to warrant it's own post (look for it later).

It's spooky, creepy, and maintains the feeling that things are about to descend into total chaos for so long that you're exhausted by the end.

In reviewing it, I found it was one of the most interesting books I've read in a while, for some good reasons and a few more curious reasons.\n\nObject-Oriented JavaScript was authored by Mr. Stefanov, who is a developer at Yahoo. It features an impressive number of reviewers (twelve), among them [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/), the author of [*JavaScript: The Good Parts*](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748/), and [Ross Harmes](http://techfoolery.com/), author of [*JavaScript Design Patterns*](http://www.apress.com/book/view/159059908x), both of whom are Stefanov's Yahoo co-workers. In a reasonable 330 pages, it features eight chapters on JavaScript's History, Basic Syntax/Features, Functions, Objects, Prototypes, Inheritance, the DOM, and Patterns/Best Practices.\n\nReaders with little to no JavaScript knowledge will be able to read this book, but I'm uncertain how much they'll be able to glean from the meaty inner chapters (functions, objects, prototypes, and inheritance). Readers with moderate JavaScript understanding should be able to learn a great deal from this book. At the very least, advanced readers should be reminded of some of the language's quirkier parts, as well as benefiting from an organized chapter on inheritance techniques.\n\nIt is tricky placing Object-Oriented JavaScript in context of the corpus of JavaScript literature. This book includes more than a little introductory material (chapters 1-2), while the core chapters (3-6) are way beyond an introduction. Only after those chapters (which I will discuss in a second) is the reader introduced briefly to the DOM and XHR before a chapter on design patterns and best practices. At a minimum, every chapter is useful and full of hints that are difficult to *grep* from run-of-the-mill JavaScript books. The book steers clear of the murky world of browser differences unless they're pertinent to the topic of Object-Oriented JavaScript, which seems perfectly acceptable.\n\nBack to those middle chapters, they are sheer gold. I am going force myself to make time to re-read this book, if not those chapters alone. They present, in a clear and organized fashion, many difficult aspects of the language, including closures, prototype, and 12 different methods for inheritance. In comparison, I believe Harmes' book isn't as well organized, and Crockford's book isn't as clear. Stefanov doesn't break much new ground here, but the clarity describing these techniques is quite valuable regardless.\n\nObject-Oriented JavaScript appears occasionally try to be something to everyone. This is kind of disappointing, since I would have _loved_ to have seen any additional discussion or insight the author could have offered in the core chapters. There are tons of introductory JavaScript books, so I don't know what a book titled Object-Oriented JavaScript gains by including more introduction. This shouldn't detract from the book's overall value. All of the chapters are well written and useful. However as a reader gains a better understanding of JavaScript, the introductory chapters will become far less useful, while the other chapters will remain an excellent reference.\n\nIn my mind, the three best JavaScript books are Flanagan's *JavaScript The Definitive Guide*, Crockford's *JavaScript: The Good Parts*, and Harmes' and \\[Dustin\\] Diaz's *Pro JavaScript Design Patterns*.

Very spooky, in a thought-required way. This movie was my pick.\n- [Dressed to Kill](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080661/) -- Continuing on the [Brian De Palma](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000361/) theme... I'm a sucker for Michael Caine.

First, lemme say that I had a good time with it, since it isn't either XSLT or Portal (my workplace's homebrew) code. It's kinda refreshing to look outside of my multi-month project. Exciting, in fact... despite how insignificant (in the grand scheme of things) it is.\n\nI've got to admit, thought, that I don't really like PHP. I'm not going to bash PHP outright (as I've heard MANY people do). It is a programming language, and it certainly has it's place. I've used many things written in PHP.  In fact, I feel bad about the way people dismiss PHP. That said, I still don't like it.  My problem is that I feel PHP is simply too verbose. There seems to be a function for everything. It is the total opposite of Scheme, where every function is a based on a handful of core functions. I have had to deal with a number of languages in my life, and I certainly prefer languages with as little syntax as possible.\n\nI spend a lot of time googling the functions. And then the parameters. And then the return types. And then I run across another function that is kinda like the first one that I saw, but slightly different (maybe even described as more or less efficient!) And then I have to research the return types.  I'm mostly bothered by the related functions. Just give me something I can use in different ways. Don't give me the kitchen sink and tell me to choose the faucet type.\n\nThis is the same problem that I have with XSLTs. It is a rather verbose language (which happens to usually be interspersed in XML/HTML). This makes it hard to pick-up in a hurry, and makes it unintuitive. This is important. Unintuitive.

These are push-style XSLTs. They have two main advantages. First, push-style gracefully handles complex source structures, including recursively nested elements. It would be near impossible to handle the following source document using pull-style,\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003Cdiv>\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cdiv>a\u003C/div>\n    \u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n```\n\nif you didn't know how deep the recursive divs would go. A push-style solution, though, is incredibly simple.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003Ctemplate match=\"div\">\n    * \u003Capply-templates>\n  \u003C/apply-templates> *\n\u003C/template>\n```\n\nWill transform the previous source into the following.\n\n```\n* * * a * * *\n```\n\nIn addition to handling complex source structures, push-style allows code reuse. This is of course an ideal of any programming language. Push-style XSLTs have a greater ability to be reused, because the individual templates can be reused. When you only have one template, it is quite difficult to make it general without resorting to numerous choose-when statements. Here is an example of code reuse, where we extend a previously written template with the xsl:apply-imports rule.\n\nGiven the input,\n\n```xml\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n\u003Cimages>\n  \u003Cimage>\n    \u003Curl>http://www.filmjunkie.com/drinks/blixa/blixa.jpg\u003C/url>\n    \u003Calt>Blixa!\u003C/alt>\n  \u003C/image>\n\u003C/images>\n```\n\nand the XSLTs,\n\n```xml\n\u003Cxsl:import href=\"imageformat.xsl\"/>\n\u003Cxsl:template match=\"image\">\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"wrapper\">\n    \u003Cxsl:apply-imports/>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/xsl:template>\n```\n\nand the rule in \"imageformat.xsl\" (the template being extended in this case),\n\n```xml\n\u003Cxsl:template match=\"image\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"{url}\" alt=\"{alt_text}\"/>\n\u003C/xsl:template>\n```\n\nthe processor will apply the higher-precedence template first, and then apply the imported (and lower-precedence) template to yield the following output.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cdiv class=\"wrapper\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"http://www.filmjunkie.com/drinks/blixa/blixa.jpg\" alt=\"Blixa!\"/>\n  \u003Cdiv>\n```\n\nPush-style XSLTs are not the most obvious thing to pick up unless you've been exposed to a functional programming language like Lisp or Scheme.

The orchestra is trying to make at least a small cultural event out of it. There is a website (embracingthemillions.com) a flickr discussion group ([flickr.com/groups/embracingthemillions](http://flickr.com/groups/embracingthemillions)), and a number of artists (not just musicians) participating in the event. Since I threw together the website (no comments please, I've been very busy), I know the statistics of people visiting it. And there are quite a few people visiting. What I can't figure out is with 30 or so people visiting per-day, why hasn't anyone a) commented, b) written something on the discussion board? I made a post in the discussion group. It took me a few minutes at best. No one else has posted. Are people's lives really so busy that they can't be bothered? I'm confused by this. Technology aside, I am delighted to be playing Beethoven, he was simply a genius.\n\nI went to see the Ingmar Bergman film, *The Magician* the other day at the [AFI Silver Theater](http://afi.com/silver). I liked the quirky nature of the film, and found it to be totally engaging (I've yet to see one of his films that isn't). I regret not being able to see more movies from the [first part of the Bergman Retrospective](http://www.afi.com/silver/new/nowplaying/2008/v5i1/bergman.aspx) they are doing now, as I have been ridiculously busy of late. However, I do own most of them on DVD (I don't own the Magician). I look forward to the next few parts of this retrospective, as I don't know as many of his later works.\n\nI have been working extremely hard on the next version of My NCBI, the preferences section of the [NCBI website](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This is where you can set preferences for PubMed, Blast, and all of the rest of the NCBI sites/databases. It is hard, writing everything in a internally-created language, which is slightly buggy and tends to make easy things easy, but hard things very hard, with XSLTs completing the system. I haven't had to write a ton of recursive XSLT functions or anything, (mostly because of the inclusion of [EXSLT extensions](http://www.exslt.org/)), but development time is still very slow. It also seems that with every step I take forward, I discover 4 new things I have to do. Throw in the fact I made time estimates without knowing the language, and the NCBI announcement that the budget fell flat (and actually decreased) this year and people were dismissed, and that makes my life particularly fun. I knew what I was getting into when I signed up, and I wanted to do a LOT of work, but that doesn't mean I feel that way every second of every day.\n\nAdditionally, I've had to meet a bunch of deadlines for the legal aspects of my dad's passing. Trips/talks to lawyers, a visit to DC Vital Records, Orphan's Court (yes, they call it that!) and NASA have really been a... treat, let's say.\n\nAlso, some of the better (or at least unexpected) and smaller moments of the month were:\n\n- Re-discovering IRC. I hadn't even thought of IRC until I saw it mentioned in a twitter post. I found, however, that the groups in irc.freenode.net are going strong. I've read some of the #scheme discussion, answered a considerable number of questions in the #html and #css groups, and just lurked watching #microformats and #javascript. Interesting stuff.\n- I've been taking [a number of photos](http://flickr.com/people/ed_welker). I like holding on to moments, which is probably why I like taking pictures so much. Hopefully I will continue. I keep telling myself that if I do, I'll upgrade to a D-SLR when I finally get all of my money issues (paying my father's bills) worked out.\n- I went on a kick of listening to nothing but David Bowie (thanks [@ashleylynn](http://twitter.com/ashleylynn)) which was nice. I've been floundering around, listening to whatever CD was closest for a while now. I love finally regaining some direction. I also feel a Prokofiev kick coming on. Maybe, maybe not.\n- I got a new monitor. A Dell 24\" flatscreen, which I really like. I knew they were coming out with new models (which have since arrived on their website), and luckily the only real difference was HDMI inputs, which I don't need since I don't plan on watching HD movies or TV on it (unless from my computer). My PC now has the 24\" as the main, and my 20\" rotated 90 deg. as a secondary. It is an extremely useful setup. I love the multiple inputs, since the press of a button on the front will switch me from PC to Mac and back again\n- The Giants won the Superbowl. That was teriffic. So my Red Sox took the World Series, my Giants have the Superbowl, who will win the NBA Championship? (Ha, not the Knicks!) But I would love to see Detroit or Boston make the finals. Especially Detroit, I think.\n- I ordered a new laptop hard-drive from [Newegg](http://newegg.com), which should arrive either today or Monday. I installed Leopard on it last month, and during that time got tired of squeezing everything onto my tiny 60gb drive. So 250gb will be here soon, and I'll transfer. I've found the only thing I really like about Leopard is Spaces, the virtual window manager. On the otherhand, it works in ways I don't expect (or think it should work). Eventually, I will look to see if there are some command line settings I can use to change behavior. For now, it will just occasionally annoy me.\n\nFinally, I am quite tired of the weather. Continual cold with occasional teases of warmer temperatures have made this, in my mind, one of the longest winters ever. I can't wait for even slightly warmer temperatures, so I can convince myself to get back outside on my bike. I haven't rode, again, in forever. I look forward to changing that.","src/content/blog/random-february-thoughts.md","f7c9e16c19dca14a",{"html":2015,"metadata":2016},"\u003Cp>In an effort to inspire me to write something else, I am throwing a few thoughts out from the last month.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My orchestra, \u003Ca href=\"http://columbiaorchestra.org\">The Columbia Orchestra\u003C/a>, is playing Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony for our next concert.

It's valuable not only as a technique for writing programs, but as a general concept for solving problems. XSLT provides many useful elements such as for-each (and apply-templates), but occasionally you will run into a problem which must be solved with recursion. Let's take a look at a real-world (no Fibonacci!!) example, where we have to operate on a simple string of numbers separated by commas. We'll take a step-by-step approach to writing a recursive template.\n\nLet's say we have the following source document, short and sweet. We want to take each number, and wrap it with an element.\n\n```xml\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n\u003Ccomma>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,88,99,100\u003C/comma>\n```\n\nThe easy way to do this is to use the [EXSLT str:tokenize function](http://www.exslt.org/str/functions/tokenize/), which takes a string and some delimiters and splits the string based on those delimiters. All we do is add the xmlns:str and extension-element-prefixes attributes to our xsl:stylesheet declaration, and then call the str:tokenize function.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cxsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"\n  version=\"1.0\" xmlns:str=\"http://exslt.org/strings\"\n  extension-element-prefixes=\"str\">\n  \u003Cxsl:template match=\"/>\n  \u003Cxsl:for-each select=\"str:tokenize( comma, ',')\">\n    \u003Cxsl:copy-of select=\".\"/>\n  \u003C/xsl:for-each>\n\u003C/xsl:template>\n\u003C/xsl:stylesheet>\n```\n\nThe result is, (new-lines added for readability):\n\n```xml\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n\u003Ctoken>1\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>2\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>3\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>4\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>5\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>6\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>7\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>88\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>99\u003C/token>\n\u003Ctoken>100\u003C/token>\n```\n\nExcellent. But let's say that we don't have access to the EXSLT functions, and we have to write a template to perform the same thing.\n\nSo now we think up a recursive algorithm. Let's look at a simplified list with three numbers, such as \"1,2,3\". First, we print the \"1\", the value before the first comma, and then we discard the first comma. At that point, our list will be \"2,3\" and we repeat, printing the new first value, and discarding the new first comma. Finally, the list becomes only \"3\". There is no comma, so we simply print out the rest of the list, \"3\". So we will be recursing over the string printing the first number, and then popping off the first number and first comma. This technique will work with a three number list, or a million-number list (though your processor will probably run out of memory before that).\n\nXPath's \"substring-before\", \"substring-after\", and \"contains\" functions are all of the tools that we'll need to implement our algorithm. \"substring-before\" lets us obtain the number before the first comma. \"substring-after\" lets us discard the first number and first comma, and \"contains\" allows us figure out the last, comma-less case.\n\nOur function starts in the same manner as all recursive functions, dealing with the last case, and then all of the cases before it. The last case will be the comma-less case from our algorithm. So here's our template skeleton.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cxsl:template name=\"splitcommas\">\n  \u003Cxsl:choose>\n    \u003Cxsl:when test=\" not(contains($comma, ','))\">\n      \u003C!-- do something -->\n      \u003C/xsl:when>\n      \u003Cxsl:otherwise>\n        \u003C!-- do something -->\n        \u003C/xsl:otherwise>\n      \u003C/xsl:choose>\n    \u003C/xsl:template>\n```\n\nWe use the XPath \"not(contains($comma, ','))\" to, obviously, test whether our list contains a comma. As you probably noticed, we don't actually have a $comma variable defined, so we'll add our xsl:param to the template.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cxsl:template name=\"splitcommas\">\n  \u003Cxsl:param name=\"comma\"/>\n  \u003Cxsl:choose>\n    \u003Cxsl:when test=\" not(contains($comma, ','))\">\n      \u003C!-- do something -->\n      \u003C/xsl:when>\n      \u003Cxsl:otherwise>\n        \u003C!-- do something -->\n        \u003C/xsl:otherwise>\n      \u003C/xsl:choose>\n    \u003C/xsl:template>\n```\n\nNow we fill in the holes in the template's framework. First, we'll handle the comma-less case, simply outputting the value wrapped in a \"value\" element.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cvalue>\n  \u003Cxsl:value-of select=\"$comma\"/>\n\u003C/value>\n```\n\nThen we will deal with the otherwise case. We'll first print out the number before the first comma in the same manner that we printed the comma-less case.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cvalue>\n  \u003Cxsl:value-of select=\"substring-before($comma, ',')\"/>\n\u003C/value>\n```\n\nThen we'll perform the same operation on the list after discarding the first number and first comma. We'll call the template again, passing everything after the first comma (thus excluding both the first number and the first comma).\n\n```xml\n\u003Cxsl:call-template name=\"splitcommas\">\n  \u003Cxsl:with-param name=\"comma\" select=\"substring-after($comma, ',')\"/>\n\u003C/xsl:call-template>\n```\n\nFinally, we'll put all of these parts together, as well as adding a root template that will call our \"splitcommas\" template.\n\n```xml\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n\u003Cxsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\" version=\"1.0\">\n  \u003Cxsl:template match=\"/\">\n    \u003Cxsl:call-template name=\"splitcommas\">\n      \u003Cxsl:with-param name=\"comma\" select=\"comma\"/>\n    \u003C/xsl:call-template>\n  \u003C/xsl:template>\n  \u003Cxsl:template name=\"splitcommas\">\n    \u003Cxsl:param name=\"comma\"/>\n    \u003Cxsl:choose>\n      \u003Cxsl:when test=\" not(contains($comma, ','))\">\n        \u003Cvalue>\n          \u003Cxsl:value-of select=\"$comma\"/>\n        \u003C/value>\n      \u003C/xsl:when>\n      \u003Cxsl:otherwise>\n        \u003Cvalue>\n          \u003Cxsl:value-of select=\"substring-before($comma, ',')\"/>\n        \u003C/value>\n        \u003Cxsl:call-template name=\"splitcommas\">\n          \u003Cxsl:with-param name=\"comma\" select=\"substring-after($comma, ',')\"/>\n        \u003C/xsl:call-template>\n      \u003C/xsl:otherwise>\n    \u003C/xsl:choose>\n  \u003C/xsl:template>\n\u003C/xsl:stylesheet>\n```\n\nWhen applied to our source document, we get exactly what we wanted, each number of the string, enclosed in a `\u003Cvalue>` element (I added new-lines for readability).\n\n```xml\n\u003C?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n\u003Cvalue>1\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>2\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>3\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>4\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>5\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>6\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>7\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>88\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>99\u003C/value>\n\u003Cvalue>100\u003C/value>\n```\n\nSo we accomplished what we were looking to accomplish by writing a recursive template, however our template only deals with commas. What if our list was separated by spaces instead of commas? We'd have to either write a new template that deals with spaces, or, better yet, modify our template to be more generic and handle many cases. I invite you to take a look at the [actual implementation of the str:tokenize function](http://www.exslt.org/str/functions/tokenize/str.tokenize.template.xsl). It isn't that much more complicated, but does contain a few interesting wrinkles.\n\nIf you're interested in the basics of recursion in general, I highly recommend [*The Little Schemer*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262560992) which is the most outstanding book I've read on the subject.","src/content/blog/recursive-xslt-templates.md","29071f1e8c8b38ec",{"html":2075,"metadata":2076},"\u003Cp>Recursion is one of the core concepts in programming.

At that point, our list will be “2,3” and we repeat, printing the new first value, and discarding the new first comma. Finally, the list becomes only “3”. There is no comma, so we simply print out the rest of the list, “3”. So we will be recursing over the string printing the first number, and then popping off the first number and first comma. This technique will work with a three number list, or a million-number list (though your processor will probably run out of memory before that).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>XPath’s “substring-before”, “substring-after”, and “contains” functions are all of the tools that we’ll need to implement our algorithm. “substring-before” lets us obtain the number before the first comma. “substring-after” lets us discard the first number and first comma, and “contains” allows us figure out the last, comma-less case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our function starts in the same manner as all recursive functions, dealing with the last case, and then all of the cases before it. The last case will be the comma-less case from our algorithm. So here’s our template skeleton.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code css-variables\" style=\"background-color:var(--astro-code-background);color:var(--astro-code-foreground); overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"xml\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">&#x3C;\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">template\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-function)\"> name\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">=\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">\"splitcommas\"\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">  &#x3C;\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">choose\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">    &#x3C;\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">when\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-function)\"> test\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">=\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">\" not(contains($comma, ','))\"\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-comment)\">      &#x3C;!-- do something -->\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">      &#x3C;/\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">when\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">      &#x3C;\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">otherwise\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-comment)\">        &#x3C;!-- do something -->\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">        &#x3C;/\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">otherwise\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">      &#x3C;/\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">choose\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\n\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">    &#x3C;/\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">xsl\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-punctuation)\">:\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-token-string-expression)\">template\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:var(--astro-code-foreground)\">>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>We use the XPath “not(contains($comma, ’,’))” to, obviously, test whether our list contains a comma.

Because of that, I've been looking at a few different books on the subject. I first started out with the [Django Book](http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/), which took me a few days to read. I can't say I absorbed it all, but I got the general idea. Then I decided to look into other books and found [*Learning Website Development with Django*](http://www.packtpub.com/django-website-development-tutorial/book), by [Ayman Hourieh](http://aymanh.com/).  I started right away.\n\nThe book's subtitle, \"*A beginner's tutorial to building web applications, quickly and cleanly, with the Django application framework*,\" frames the book perfectly. Its target audience is programmers (moderately) familiar with Python, but who are, at the same time, new to Django. The book is really focused towards this audience. The other key word in the subtitle is \"quickly.\" This book moves along in a hurry while creating the demonstration app. I was quite comfortable (and pleased) by the pace, however, I can imagine that a more novice programmer may have a harder time dealing with the information flying by.\n\nThe book centers on building one app, a social bookmarking website similar to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), or ma.gnolia. I think type of site was a good choice, since it provides the author with a varying degree of complexity to play around with. It allowed Mr. Hourieh to start with the basics. This book succeeds in starting simple and getting harder as it goes along. I also thought it was good to focus on creating just one website, rather than a bunch of mini-projects or examples, since it models a more real-life situation. The idea of a social bookmarking website, as well, is very useful because its features are currently *en vogue*, and can be found on many current sites.\n\nChapters One and Two are the obligatory \"what is Django\" and \"how to install\" chapters. The meat of the book starts in Chapter Three when the project is introduced.  By the end of this third chapter, we've already quickly written three database models (Links, Users, and Bookmarks) and the main page. Chapter Four introduces Django's built-in user authentication system (django.contrib.auth), and describes how to write login, logout, and registration pages. Chapter Five instructs us to write an additional database model (tags), which is more complex than the models we wrote previously. Here we also write pages to display the list of bookmarks, bookmarks by tags, and a tag cloud. \\[To illustrate how fast we're moving, Chapter Five ends on page 91\\]\n\nMr. Hourieh adds occasional asides throughout *Learning Website Development with Django,* such as one on security at the end of Chapter Five. Personally, I'd have liked to see more of these, but I think he consciously limited the number to better suit the book's audience.\n\nChapter Six introduces AJAX behaviors, using the jQuery library. The author includes a lightning-fast tutorial on jQuery. The reader is then shown how to implement a live search display, in-place bookmark editing, and a tag auto-complete feature. Chapter Seven adds both a voting and commenting system to our application. The user writes a new database model (Shared Bookmark), and shows how to implement comments piggy-backing on Django's built-in comment system (django.contrib.comments).\n\nIn Chapter Eight, we are finally introduced to Django's built-in Administration Interface (django.contrib.admin), and the reader is shown how to customize the admin pages and deal with user permissions. Chapter Nine describes adding RSS feeds, Pagination, and advanced search capabilities to our application. We're taught how to create advanced model queries using both the objects.filter() function and Q objects to build multi-faceted queries.\n\nChapter Ten focuses on adding a \"Friend\" data model to the application. This chapter demonstrates how Django can be used to send email (friend 'invites' in this case), and how the bookmark application can be used to handle activation links. Chapter Eleven covers three topics; language translation, caching, and unit testing. None of these are as \"flashy\" as the previously covered topics, but they are given adequate mention. The final chapter, Chapter Twelve mentions a number of advanced topics that the reader is left to research on his/her own.\n\nThe book is generally well written. I like the structure. The chapter beginnings outline a plan for implementation, and the remainders proceed step-by-step. I would have liked the writing to have been polished a little more. The language seems too formal in places, and when you mix in a number of technical ideas, the language can distract. This however, may just be a personal preference.\n\nThe more I think about *Learning Website Development with Django*, the more I like it. It is well suited for someone who wants to get off the ground quickly; someone who needs to get something done and can worry about the details when they need to. It's not a bible, but it's not trying to be, and I think that's where it really succeeds.","src/content/blog/review-of-learning-website-development-with-django.md","2b916ff6f6cb1ee3",{"html":2286,"metadata":2287},"\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/django-website-development-tutorial/book\">\u003Cimg src=\"/learningwebsitedjango.jpg\" alt=\"Cover, Learning Website Development with Django\" title=\"Cover, Learning Website Development with Django\">\u003C/a>Over the past few weeks, I’ve been playing around with Django.

I thought it would be an interesting read, but forgot to bookmark it, and forgot to look into it further. Once I finally remembered it, it proved hard to find (and an expensive gamble from Amazon), until I found it through NIH's interlibrary loan system.\n\nI was quite excited to get my hands on a copy of this book, I was interested in learning more about the general theory that went into languages with prototypal inheritance. I thought this would allow me a special insight into JavaScript. However, as I found reading it... despite it's 1999 publication date, JavaScript wasn't even mentioned in the book! Regardless, I found parts of it to be quite interesting and insightful.\n\nThe book is broken up into three sections (as mentioned on the cover), Concepts, Languages, and Applications. Each section has 4 associated chapters which are really various papers, some of which seem to be difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nThe first section, \"Concepts\" was the most interesting. The first was titled \"Classes vs. Prototypes: Some Philosophical and Historical Observations.\" This chapter provided a nice introduction to the topic, including the history of classification, going back to Aristotle and proceeding to Ludwig Wittgenstein who had an interesting example about classifying the characteristics of an item as simple as a \"game\". It goes on to transition to a programming perspective. A point that is made repeatedly throughout many chapters that the idea of classical inheritance necessitating construction from the top (superclasses) to the bottom (subclasses) is inherently contradictory to the way humans think. When unfamiliar with a domain, a person can more easily deal with concrete examples, and only discern the abstract general form after discovering these patterns in the concrete cases. Though unable to put my finger on this idea, I've experienced it a number of times when programming myself, and couldn't agree more.\n\nThe next chapter, \"Classifying Prototype-based Programming Languages\" sought to categorize the theoritical aspects of different prototypal languages. This is the chapter where I most missed the reference to JavaScript, but I may look into doing that myself some other day. \"The Stripetalk Papers: Understandability as a Language Design Issue in Object-Oriented Programming Systems\", made an argument that prototype based systems could be used to enhance the learnability of languages. Finally, the chapter \"Classes versus Prototypes in Object-Oriented Languages\" looked at the advantages and disadvantages of class-based and prototype-based languages. This chapter was quite interesting, however brief.\n\nThe second section, \"Languages\", lacking JavaScript, was less useful than I had hoped. \"Programming as an Experience: The Inspiration for Self\" was interesting as it described the thought process going into creating the Self language, and expanded some of the ideas presented in the book's second chapter. Alas, I've haven't yet gotten around to learning Self, but the ideas and history presented were interesting in the abstract. \"NewtonScript: Prototypes on the Palm\" was interesting mostly because of it's Lisp-like syntax and it's description of internal closures, while \"The Prototype-Instance Object Systems in Amulet and Garnet\" took an in-depth look at the implementation of these two languages. I only skimmed the \"Omega: Statically Typed Prototypes\" chapter, as it was rather brief, and I don't feel confident enough (or have any real desire) to enter the static-typed/dynamic-typed languages argument.\n\nThe final section, \"Applications\", was where this book showed it's age. \"Self includes: Smalltalk\" involved translating Smalltalk programs into Self, which is interesting, but I don't see much practical application for this today (maybe if you're translating Ruby to JavaScript? Not sure). \"Using Prototypes for Program Restructuring\" demonstrated the use of an algorithm that would help to restructure code into a slot-based prototype system in a application called Guru. \"Prototype-Based Programming for Abstract Program Visualisation\" ended up being skimmed, because while the topic matter seemed interesting, the demonstrations from the black-and-white mac era looked totally antiquated, and I am sure that they have been written many times in other languages since the writing. Finally, \"Agora: The Scheme of Object-Orientation, or, the Simplest MOP in the World\" detailed the Agora language, a pure OO language which relied only on objects and message passing, while being implemented as a reflective language inspired by Scheme, of all things. Weird, but interesting.\n\nYou know as well as I do that computer technology is a moving target, and something published in 1999 will be outdated to a certain degree. The good part of this book is that the abstract notions in it are rather timeless, as they have been built on over time.

It's an incredibly simple way to make a form more accessible. It does two things:\n\n- It explicitly associates text with a form element, so a screenreader doesn't have to guess what text goes with what form element.\n- For checkboxes/radio buttons, it gives the user a larger click area, which is useful for people with limited vision (or me, since I always end up missing them!)\n\nYou can find a number of simple usage examples on the [W3C's WCAG Techniques page for labels](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44.html).\n\nI recently discovered something new about the `\u003Clabel>` element (new to me). I hadn't realized that you can associate **multiple labels** to one form element. This is useful because it allows you to associate even more information with a form element. With it, I could write something like this:\n\n```xml\n\u003Clabel for=\"box\">1. \u003C/label>\n\u003Cinput type=\"checkbox\" id=\"box\"/>\n\u003Clabel for=\"box\">This is some text with a\n```\n\n```xml\n\u003Cabbr title=\"full title name\">shrt. title\u003C/abbr> other stuff inside.\u003C/label>\n```\n\nThis isn't the most useful example, but I think it demonstrates the general idea. \\[Note: normally, I wouldn't write out an explicit number, I would use an unordered list. But without major support for [CSS counters](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/generate.html#counters \"CSS Counters\"), I find myself between a rock and a hard place.\\] My optimism was quickly quashed though, because, as [Roger Johansson mentions, screenreaders tend to ignore two labels](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200711/use_the_label_element_to_make_your_html_forms_accessible/). I will have to do some of my own testing to find out more, but I find this very disappointing.\n\nAnother interesting application is to include labels for screenreaders, while using CSS to hide them from visual users. Just make your label a block element, give it a 0 width (to remove the width it would have taken in the document flow), and move it off-screen. You cannot simply `display: none` the label, as that usually hides it from screenreaders. I would like to look further into the end result using current technology ([hoping for improved results since 2004](http://juicystudio.com/article/invisible-form-prompts.php)), but I certainly believe this leaves **no excuse** for anyone NOT including labels in their forms.\n\nBack to using one label again, I ran into a [Firefox Bug where a link is included in a label element](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163912). When a link is clicked inside a label element that is associated with a checkbox, the checkbox becomes checked!

Often, you need an exact copy of an element verbatim, but other times you need to selectively choose certain elements to copy and others to discard. XSLT makes this process quite elegant using it's xsl:copy-of and xsl:copy elements. The following is a setp-by-step tutorial on how these elements are used.\n\nWhen you need an exact copy of an element and it's children, you use the xsl:copy-of element, which makes an exact copy of the selected element and it's children. Given the following XML data, which represents a (trivial) inventory of a store, let's say you want an exact copy of any items with the name \"XSLT\".\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"??>\n  \u003Cinventory>\n    \u003Citem id=\"1\">\n      \u003Cname>The Little Schemer\u003C/name>\n      \u003Ctype>book\u003C/type>\n      \u003Cauthor>Friedman\u003C/author>\n      \u003Cauthor>Felleisen\u003C/author>\n      \u003Clist-price>29.95\u003C/list-price>\n      \u003Csell-price>26.99\u003C/sell-price>\n      \u003Ccost>17.92\u003C/cost>\n    \u003C/item>\n    \u003Citem id=\"2\">\n      \u003Cname>XSLT\u003C/name>\n      \u003Ctype>book\u003C/type>\n      \u003Cauthor>Tidwell\u003C/author>\n      \u003Clist-price>49.95\u003C/list-price>\n      \u003Csell-price>34.99\u003C/sell-price>\n      \u003Ccost>22.92\u003C/cost>\n    \u003C/item>\n    \u003Citem id=\"3\">\n      \u003Cname>Romeo and Juliet\u003C/name>\n      \u003Ctype>compact disc\u003C/type>\n      \u003Cconductor>Rostropovich\u003C/conductor>\n      \u003Clist-price>18.98\u003C/list-price>\n      \u003Csell-price>13.99\u003C/sell-price>\n      \u003Ccost>9.92\u003C/cost>\n    \u003C/item>\n  \u003C/inventory>\n```\n\nYou simply apply the following XSLT stylesheet to your source document:\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"??>\n  \u003Cstylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"/\">\n      \u003Ccopy-of select=\"inventory/item[name = 'XSLT']\">\n      \u003C/copy-of>\n    \u003C/template>\n  \u003C/stylesheet>\n```\n\nWhich gives you exactly what you were looking for, the \"item\" with the name \"XSLT\".\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"??>\n  \u003Citem id=\"2\">\n    \u003Cname>XSLT\u003C/name>\n    \u003Ctype>book\u003C/type>\n    \u003Cauthor>Tidwell\u003C/author>\n    \u003Clist-price>49.95\u003C/list-price>\n    \u003Csell-price>34.99\u003C/sell-price>\n    \u003Ccost>22.92\u003C/cost>\n  \u003C/item>\n```\n\nThat was easy, so now let's say you want to do a little more with your inventory document. Your boss wants a copy of it to look at the numbers and do some accounting. She doesn't care about the authors or conductors, so she'd like that information left out. Also, she would like an additional piece of information for each item, the amount of profit off each item sold, the difference between the sell-price and the cost.\n\nBecause we are adding a piece of information and getting rid of elements that don't affect the accounting, we can't use a xsl:copy-of, because that would output an exact copy of the item element, it's attribute nodes, and it's child nodes. This exact copy is called a *deep copy*, because it not only copies the element, but all of it's children as well. The solution is to use xsl:copy which performs a *shallow copy*, which means it **only** copies the current node, and ignores all children or attribute nodes.\n\nSince xsl:copy only copies one element at a time, you need to explicitly specify that you want to continue copying attribute nodes and child nodes. xsl:apply-templates gives us the leverage to write a template that accomplishes that. The following template starts by matching attribute and children nodes, then copies the node, and recursively applies itself to any attribute or child nodes found in the source tree.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003Ctemplate match=\"@*|node()\">\n    \u003Ccopy>\n      \u003Capply-templates select=\"@*|node()\">\n      \u003C/apply-templates>\n    \u003C/copy>\n  \u003C/template>\n```\n\nUsing this template, I can write a XSLT stylesheet that will copy the entire source document without any changes. This isn't quite what we were looking for, because we wanted to add and remove child elements of item, but this is the first step.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"??>\n  \u003Cstylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"/\">\n      \u003Capply-templates>\n      \u003C/apply-templates>\n    \u003C/template>\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"@*|node()\">\n      \u003Ccopy>\n        \u003Capply-templates select=\"@*|node()\">\n        \u003C/apply-templates>\n      \u003C/copy>\n    \u003C/template>\n  \u003C/stylesheet>\n```\n\nSo how do we add the profit made from each item and remove the unnecessary information? We use the fact that our xsl:match=\"@\\*|node()\" template has a very low priority. Determination of default XSLT priorities are an advanced topic I won't go into right now, but feel free to [explore the topic](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#conflict) if [you are interested](http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N7654.html#d11689e235). Our template is essentially given a priority of -.5. Templates such as xsl:template match=\"foo\", however, are given a default priority of 0. Because templates matching element names are higher priority, we can easily figure out how to remove the \"author\" and \"conductor\" elements, just declare templates without outputs!\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003Ctemplate match=\"author\">\n  \u003C/template>\n  \u003Ctemplate match=\"conductor\">\n  \u003C/template>\n```\n\nWe use the same technique to add an element to our \"item\" elements. First we use xsl:copy to copy the item node itself. Then we apply-templates to any attribute or children nodes found. When an author or conductor element is found, it will match our explicit rules and produce no output, therefore they will not be copied into our result. Finally, we create a new element named \"profit\" which will contain the difference between the sell-price and the cost.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003Ctemplate match=\"item\">\n    \u003Ccopy>\n      \u003Capply-templates select=\"@*|node()\">\n      \u003C/apply-templates>\n      \u003Cprofit>\n        \u003Cvalue-of select=\"(sell-price - cost)\">\n        \u003C/value-of>\n      \u003C/profit>\n    \u003C/copy>\n  \u003C/template>\n```\n\nSo we arrive at our final XSLT stylesheet, which looks like this:\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"??>\n  \u003Cstylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"/\">\n      \u003Capply-templates>\n      \u003C/apply-templates>\n    \u003C/template>\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"item\">\n      \u003Ccopy>\n        \u003Capply-templates select=\"@*|node()\">\n        \u003C/apply-templates>\n        \u003Cprofit>\n          \u003Cvalue-of select=\"(sell-price - cost)\">\n          \u003C/value-of>\n        \u003C/profit>\n      \u003C/copy>\n    \u003C/template>\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"author\">\n    \u003C/template>\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"conductor\">\n    \u003C/template>\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"@*|node()\">\n      \u003Ccopy>\n        \u003Capply-templates select=\"@*|node()\">\n        \u003C/apply-templates>\n      \u003C/copy>\n    \u003C/template>\n  \u003C/stylesheet>\n```\n\nWhen applied to our source document, we get the result our boss wanted, it excludes any \"author\" or \"composer\" elements, and includes a \"profit\" element.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"??>\n  \u003Cinventory>\n    \u003Citem id=\"1\">\n      \u003Cname>The Little Schemer\u003C/name>\n      \u003Ctype>book\u003C/type>\n      \u003Clist-price>29.95\u003C/list-price>\n      \u003Csell-price>26.99\u003C/sell-price>\n      \u003Ccost>17.92\u003C/cost>\n      \u003Cprofit>9.07\u003C/profit>\n    \u003C/item>\n    \u003Citem id=\"2\">\n      \u003Cname>XSLT\u003C/name>\n      \u003Ctype>book\u003C/type>\n      \u003Clist-price>49.95\u003C/list-price>\n      \u003Csell-price>34.99\u003C/sell-price>\n      \u003Ccost>22.92\u003C/cost>\n      \u003Cprofit>12.07\u003C/profit>\n    \u003C/item>\n    \u003Citem id=\"3\">\n      \u003Cname>Romeo and Juliet\u003C/name>\n      \u003Ctype>compact disc\u003C/type>\n      \u003Clist-price>18.98\u003C/list-price>\n      \u003Csell-price>13.99\u003C/sell-price>\n      \u003Ccost>9.92\u003C/cost>\n      \u003Cprofit>4.07\u003C/profit>\n    \u003C/item>\n  \u003C/inventory>\n```\n\nUsing this technique, we can then easily prepare another XSLT stylesheet to generate an inventory list for the customer, which will exclude the \"cost\" element, since we don't want them knowing it! All we need is to match all attribute and children nodes and copy them as normal, while providing no output when the XSLT processor encounters a \"cost\" element.\n\n```xml\n\u003Cpre lang=\"xml\">\n  \u003C?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"??>\n  \u003Cstylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"/\">\n      \u003Capply-templates>\n      \u003C/apply-templates>\n    \u003C/template>\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"cost\">\n    \u003C/template>\n    \u003Ctemplate match=\"@*|node()\">\n      \u003Ccopy>\n        \u003Capply-templates select=\"@*|node()\">\n        \u003C/apply-templates>\n      \u003C/copy>\n    \u003C/template>\n  \u003C/stylesheet>\n```\n\nPersonally, because I end up transforming XML sources to XML output, I end up using xsl:copy-of and xsl:template match=\"@\\*|node()\" all the time. In fact, xsl:template match=\"@\\*|node()\" just happens to be the first piece of code in my XSLT toolbox.","src/content/blog/xslt-copy-copy-of.md","e80db10af9b246d7",{"html":2990,"metadata":2991},"\u003Cp>Using XSLT to copy elements is extremely common when you’re transforming a source document of a certain type (XML, HTML, etc.) to the same type.

easy, so now let’s say you want to do a little more with your inventory document. Your boss wants a copy of it to look at the numbers and do some accounting. She doesn’t care about the authors or conductors, so she’d like that information left out. Also, she would like an additional piece of information for each item, the amount of profit off each item sold, the difference between the sell-price and the cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because we are adding a piece of information and getting rid of elements that don’t affect the accounting, we can’t use a xsl:copy-of, because that would output an exact copy of the item element, it’s attribute nodes, and it’s child nodes. This exact copy is called a \u003Cem>deep copy\u003C/em>, because it not only copies the element, but all of it’s children as well. The solution is to use xsl:copy which performs a \u003Cem>shallow copy\u003C/em>, which means it \u003Cstrong>only\u003C/strong> copies the current node, and ignores all children or attribute nodes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since xsl:copy only copies one element at a time, you need to explicitly specify that you want to continue copying attribute nodes and child nodes. xsl:apply-templates gives us the leverage to write a template that accomplishes that.
