recipeIngredient:
  - "Dough: 1.5 cups flour (all-purpose)"
  - "Dough: 1/2 tbsp salt"
  - "Dough: 1 egg"
  - "Dough: 2 tbsp milk or water (adjust for shaggy texture)"
  - "1/2 stick butter (European or Amish creamery preferred)"
  - "1 large onion, diced"
  - "1 large head cabbage, cored and thinly sliced"
  - "Garlic (optional, 2-3 cloves)"
  - "1/2 cup chicken broth (optional for moisture)"
  - "Salt and Black Pepper to taste"
  - "Caraway seeds (semi-optional)"
  - "Marjoram (optional)"
  - "Acid (Required for serving): Sour Cream, Cwikla (horseradish beets), or Yellow Mustard"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Prepare the dough: Mix flour, salt, egg, and just enough liquid to form a dry, shaggy dough. It should clump slightly."
  - "Cook the noodles: Drop bits of the dough into boiling salted water until they float and are cooked through. Drain and set aside."
  - "Prepare the cabbage: Thinly slice the cabbage. Optional: Salt and massage the cabbage beforehand to reduce water and aid browning."
  - "Sauté aromatics: Melt butter in a large pan. Add diced onions and cook until translucent."
  - "Cook cabbage: Add the cabbage to the pan. Cook until wilted and starting to brown. If using garlic, caraway seeds, or marjoram, add it all in the last 5 minutes of cooking."
  - "Combine: Add the cooked noodles to the pan. Stir to combine. Add chicken broth if the mixture is too dry."
  - "Season and Serve: Season generously with salt and pepper. Serve immediately with a required acid component like sour cream, horseradish, or mustard to balance the flavors."

## Notes

* For a quick version, just use a 1lb bag of egg noodles.
* Authentic Variation (Bacon or Kielbasa): Fry 4oz of chopped bacon first. Use the rendered fat instead of some butter to cook the onions/cabbage for better flavor.
* Authentic Variation (Sauerkraut): Replace half the fresh cabbage with rinsed sauerkraut to add natural acidity and texture.
