recipeIngredient:
  - "15 frozen pelmeni (per person)"
  - "Water or stock/broth"
  - "1/2 onion (optional)"
  - "Black pepper to taste (optional)"
  - "1 bay leaf (optional)"
  - "Salt to taste"
  - "Sour cream, butter, or mayo (for serving)"
  - "Green onions or fresh dill, chopped (for serving)"
  - "Horseradish, mustard, or tomato sauce (optional)"
  - "Pickles and black bread (optional side)"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Note: Most aromatics and toppings are optional and can be adjusted to taste."
  - "Separate any frozen pelmeni that are stuck together."
  - "Fill a pot with water or stock. For better flavor, add the onion half, black pepper, and bay leaf before bringing to a boil."
  - "Add salt to the boiling water and drop in the pelmeni. Stir slightly so they don’t stick."
  - "Wait for the pelmeni to float. Once floating, continue boiling for 2-5 minutes (longer for store-bought) to ensure the filling is cooked through."
  - "Standard serving: Use a skimmer to transfer to a plate, with or without bouillon."
  - "Optional pan-fry: Drain the boiled pelmeni. Heat butter or oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Fry the pelmeni for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy."
  - "Serve with sour cream, butter, or mayo and garnish with chopped green onions or dill. Pair with black bread and pickles for the traditional experience."
