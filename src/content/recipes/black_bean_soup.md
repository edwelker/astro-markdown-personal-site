reference: "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015847-pressure-cooker-black-bean-soup"
recipeIngredient:
  - "1 tablespoon olive oil"
  - "1 cup coarsely chopped onion"
  - "1 tablespoon mild or hot chile powder (feel free to get creative here)"
  - "1 1/2 teaspoons whole cumin seeds"
  - "1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves"
  - "7 cups water"
  - "1 pound (2 1/2 cups) black beans, picked over and rinsed"
  - "4 ounces diced Spanish chorizo (optional)"
  - "4 to 6 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "2 bay leaves"
  - "Salt to taste"
recipeInstructions:
  - "In a 6-quart or larger stovetop pressure cooker or an electric pressure cooker, heat the oil over medium-high heat or using the sauté function. Stir in the onions, chile powder, cumin and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to soften, about 1 minute."
  - "Add the water, beans, chorizo (if using), garlic and bay leaves."
  - "Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Reduce the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 45 minutes. If using an electric pressure cooker, cook on high pressure for 45 minutes."
  - "Turn off the heat if using a stovetop cooker, and allow the pressure to come down naturally, about 15 minutes. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow the steam to escape."
  - "Stir well. Discard the bay leaves and add salt to taste. The soup will thicken on standing."
  - "Ladle the soup into bowls and serve."

## Additional Notes

* The original calls for 30m of cooking, but it's never taken less than 45 for me.
* Chorizo is optional, but I've yet to figure out the perfect replacement. Some good Chinese Light Soy Sauce and Chinese red pepper mix is a good start, however. (and a little MSG if you feel like it)
