recipeIngredient:
  - "3 large crowns broccoli"
  - "1 package firm tofu OR small pack thin chicken breasts"
  - "4 cloves garlic, finely minced"
  - "Ginger, finely minced (slightly less than garlic amount)"
  - "Red pepper flakes (optional)"
  - "Cooking oil"
  - "Sauce: 1 bouillon cube (chicken or veggie)"
  - "Sauce: Dark soy sauce (for color) and Light soy sauce"
  - "Sauce: 1.5 tbsp sugar (white or brown)"
  - "Sauce: Oyster sauce, white wine, sesame oil (all optional additions)"
  - "Sauce: Water (enough to make total liquid 3/4 cup)"
  - "Thickener: 2-3 tsp cornstarch mixed 1:1 with water"
recipeInstructions:
  - "Marinade the protein (tofu or chicken) briefly with a splash of soy sauce or wine."
  - "Steam the broccoli: Place in an Instant Pot, bring to pressure (0 minutes setting), and immediately quick release. This yields barely undercooked steamed broccoli."
  - "Prepare the sauce: Dissolve the bouillon cube and sugar in water, soy sauces, and optional aromatics until you have 3/4 cup of liquid."
  - "Heat oil in a pan. Cook the protein most of the way through. Remove and set aside."
  - "Add the minced garlic, ginger, and optional red pepper flakes to the pan. Cook until browned."
  - "Pour in the sauce mixture and cook until warm. Stir in the cornstarch slurry. The sauce should thicken almost instantly."
  - "Toss the broccoli and protein back into the pan to coat. Serve immediately, optionally topped with sesame or chili oil."
