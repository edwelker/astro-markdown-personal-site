Tonight I tried a new recipe tonight, on a whim (I hit up the grocery store on the way home from work]. It was my first time making any pizza, much less two whole large pizzas, and they turned out extremely well. Only tools used were a food processor (with dough blade), oven, two pizza pans, and a pizza cutter. Adding the recipe here for my own records.

No, I did not make the sauce. Needed to save something for next time!!! Actually, next time I will let the dough rise in the fridge either from AM to PM, or overnight, though that may be overdoing it a bit. We'll see.
