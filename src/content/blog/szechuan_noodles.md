My base recipe for Szechuan noodles (noods).

## Ingredients

Almost all of these are optional, though the sugar is essential for the "warming" effect.

* ⅓ teaspoon mushroom or other MSG powder (chicken, etc.)
* Chili oil
* Lao Gan Ma Chili in Oil & Chili Crisp (I prefer the Chili in oil, though a little Chili Crisp can be nice)
* Garlic (not more than 2 cloves, finely minced)
* Dried Chili (the Chengdu dried are amazing, and totally different than Western)
* Tahini or deep sesame paste (⅓ teaspoon)
* Any amount of dried peppers to taste (use less “Danshan” type chili/fennel than usual)
* Optional: ⅓ teaspoon Chinese vinegar
* Sugar to taste (not optional)
* Chinese five spice
* 1 teaspoon Chinese soy sauce
* Salt to taste

## Process

1. **Prep the bowl:** Compose all the ingredients above into a large serving bowl.
2. **Cook:** Boil the noods.
3. **Bloom:** Ladle about ⅓ or ½ of a cup of the boiling noodle water over the mix in the bowl. This is the key step—it "blooms" the spices and takes the raw edge off the garlic.
4. **Finish:** Add the noodles to the bowl and mix thoroughly.
