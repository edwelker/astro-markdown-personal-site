Getting away from all this traffic and signing the lease to my new place today. Woo hoo! Or at least I think woo hoo.

Not going to start moving in yet, because I have a month overlap to do that.

Slightly scared, however, that I am looking forward to going back there so I can re-evaluate the place in my mind... for size and things like that. Shouldn't I know that beforehand? Oh well.

7pm... and counting.
