The Red Sox just swept the Chicago White Sox, outscoring them 46-7 in four games. I'm happy that they distanced themselves from the Yankees, and that their bats heated up before heading into New York. This series, however, was eerily similar to the 5 game series where the Yankees swept the Red Sox last August, so I can't get particularly excited about it. Chicago deserved better.
