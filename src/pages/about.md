Hi, I'm Eddie Welker (technically Edward Welker, but I stick to Eddie).

Part programmer, cellist, biker, and photographer, I live in the suburbs of Maryland, spend time on Long Island, and ride bikes wherever I can.

I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience, and I am exceptional at what I do. I am a natural leader skilled at guiding teams through big organizational changes. I'm good at [Python](https://www.python.org/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), Data, and more!

I love riding my bicycles, and I own too many of them. I've done 3 straight yearly tours of the [GAP](https://gaptrail.org/)/[C&O](https://www.nps.gov/choh/index.htm), the [Erie Canal](https://eriecanalway.org/), and a bunch of other shorter tours. Riding is one of the things that brings me great joy. Especially on my [All-City Space Horse](/blog/2025/12/05/all_city_space_horse/). That and my cat Sophie.

I’ve played the cello since fourth grade. I love music (of almost all genres) and enjoy listening to, playing, and reading about music history. My favorite cellist has always been [Mstislav Rostropovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mstislav_Rostropovich), and I am especially fond of 20th-century Russian composers like [Prokofiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Prokofiev), [Shostakovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Shostakovich), and [Miaskovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Myaskovsky). I used to be principal cellist of the [Columbia Orchestra](https://columbiaorchestra.org/), and a member of the [University of Maryland](https://music.umd.edu/) and [Greater Baltimore Youth Orchestras](https://bsomusic.org/education-community/young-musicians/baltimore-symphony-youth-orchestras/).

I am also a bit of a foodie. I enjoy cooking and have been known to spend time pickling or hunting down the best ingredients for a recipe.

I’m a photo geek as well. My dad was a big [Olympus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Corporation) fan, so I chose that brand to use all of the lenses that were around. I’m still relatively new to this, but try to get better with every picture I take. I started with an Olympus E-520, basically wore out a [Nikon D700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D700), and now love my [Nikon D780](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D780).

I’m an avid [Red Sox](https://www.mlb.com/redsox) fan who grew up watching them during the summers I spent at my grandparents' house.

I used to use [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) to make things easier, but I finally foolishly decided it was time to break the cardinal sin, and develop my own site from scratch. For the third time. First I tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and now this site is on [Astro](https://astro.build/).
