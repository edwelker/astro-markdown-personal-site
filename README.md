# Website: Astro version

This is the repository for my personal site, eddiewelker.com.

It uses the [Astro Micro](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro) theme, as well as the [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter/) font.

### History

1.  **WordPress (The Origin):** What I could do at the time, the exported from WP
2.  **Hugo (The Static Phase):** Templating was terrible because each had their own individual config format, so I couldn't switch templates easily.
3.  **Astro (The Final Form):** This current version is built on Astro. Standardized markdown schema and configuration.
